# BREWERYDB-API BEER APP

- I used the BreweryDB-API, but I used the API on the back-end with: Express, Cors, Axios. Created with index.js and router.



- Front-end I used with: React, Redux, Axios and Bootstrap. Created with actions, components, reducers and store.



# The firt button of Beers if you click you will see the Names of the beers, Description, if is Organic or not.
# The seconnd button of Beers Location if you click you will see Beer city, Region and Locality.

- You can clone and run by npm run start.

Here you can watch how the app works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dksv0j0QQTo&feature=youtu.be
